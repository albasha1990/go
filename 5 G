[[File:Android 5G signal.png|thumb|An Android phone, showing that it is connected to a 5G network]]
In [[telecommunications]], '''5G''' is the [[List of wireless network technologies|fifth-generation]] [[Technical standard|technology standard]] for [[cellular network]]s, which [[mobile network operator|cellular phone companies]] began deploying worldwide in 2019, and is the successor to [[4G]] technology that provides connectivity to most current mobile phones.

Like its predecessors, 5G networks are cellular networks, in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas called ''cells''. All 5G wireless devices in a cell are connected to the [[Internet]] and the [[telephone network]] by [[radio wave]]s through a [[cellular base station|basestation]] and antennae in the cell. The new networks have higher [[download speed]]s, with a peak speed of 10&nbsp;[[gigabits per second]] (Gbit/s) when there is only one user in the network.<ref name="Hoffman">{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/340002/what-is-5g-and-how-fast-will-it-be/|title=What is 5G, and how fast will it be? |last=Hoffman|first=Chris|date=January 7, 2019|work=How-To Geek website|publisher=How-To Geek LLC|access-date=January 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124041504/https://www.howtogeek.com/340002/what-is-5g-and-how-fast-will-it-be/|archive-date=January 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> 5G has higher [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to deliver faster speeds than 4G and can connect more devices, improving the quality of Internet services in crowded areas.<ref>{{cite news|title=5G explained: What it is, who has 5G, and how much faster is it really?|url=https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/03/business/what-is-5g/|access-date=November 27, 2021|website=www.cnn.com|archive-date=November 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211127064719/https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/03/business/what-is-5g/|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected the 5G networks will increasingly be used as general [[internet service provider]]s (ISPs), competing with existing ISPs such as [[cable internet]], and also will make possible new applications in [[internet of things|internet-of-things]] (IoT) and [[machine to machine|machine-to-machine]] areas. Cellphones with [[4G]] capability are unable to use the 5G networks.

== Overview ==
[[File:Mobile Base Station 01.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|Mobile base station at Hatta city, UAE]]
5G networks are [[cellular network]]s, in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas called ''cells''. All 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a [[cellular base station]] via fixed [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s, over frequencies assigned by the base station. The base stations, termed [[Node (networking)|node]]s, are connected to switching centers in the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and routers for [[Internet access]] by high-bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connections]]. As in other [[cellular network]]s, a mobile device moving from one cell to another is automatically [[Handover|handed off]] seamlessly.

The industry consortium setting standards for 5G, the [[3rd Generation Partnership Project]] (3GPP), defines "5G" as any system using [[5G NR]] (5G New Radio) software — a definition that came into general use by late 2018. 5G continues to use [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] encoding.

Several network operators use [[millimeter wave]]s or [[Mm-wave|MM-Wave]] called [[5G NR frequency bands#Frequency Range 2|FR2]] in 5G terminology, for additional capacity and higher throughputs. Millimeter waves have a shorter range than the lower frequency [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are of a smaller size. Millimeter waves also have more trouble passing through building walls and humans. Millimeter-wave antennas are smaller than the large antennas used in previous cellular networks.

The increased data rate is achieved partly by using additional higher-frequency radio waves in addition to the low- and medium-band frequencies used in previous cellular networks. For providing a wide range of services, 5G networks can operate in three frequency bands — low, medium or high.

5G can be implemented in low-band, mid-band or high-band millimeter-wave. Low-band 5G uses a similar frequency range to 4G cellphones, 600–900&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], which can potentially offer higher download speeds than 4G: 5–250&nbsp;[[megabits per second]] (Mbit/s).<ref name="Horwitz">{{cite web|last=Horwitz|first=Jeremy|date=December 10, 2019|title=The definitive guide to 5G low, mid, and high band speeds|url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/10/the-definitive-guide-to-5g-low-mid-and-high-band-speeds/|access-date=April 23, 2020|publisher=VentureBeat online magazine|archive-date=November 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201105185156/https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/10/the-definitive-guide-to-5g-low-mid-and-high-band-speeds/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="DeLooper">{{cite web|last1=De Looper|first1=Christian|last2=Jansen|first2=Mark|date=April 22, 2022|title=Is 5G as fast as they're saying?

Mid-band 5G uses [[microwaves]] of 1.7–4.7&nbsp;[[gigahertz|GHz]], allowing speeds of 100–900&nbsp;Mbit/s, with each cell tower providing service up to several kilometers in radius. This level of service is the most widely deployed, and was deployed in many metropolitan areas in 2020. Some regions are not implementing the low band, making Mid-band the minimum service level. High-band 5G uses frequencies of 24–47&nbsp;GHz, near the bottom of the millimeter wave band, although higher frequencies may be used in the future. It often achieves download speeds in the&nbsp;[[gigabits per second|gigabit-per-second]] (Gbit/s) range, comparable to co-axial cable Internet service. However, [[millimeter wave]]s (mmWave or mmW) have a more limited range, requiring many small cells.<ref name="Nokia">{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Darrell|date=May 20, 2019|title=Small Cells – Big in 5G|url=https://www.nokia.com/blog/small-cells-big-5g/|access-date=August 29, 2020|publisher=Nokia|archive-date=November 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101102629/https://www.nokia.com/blog/small-cells-big-5g/|url-status=live}}</ref> They can be impeded or blocked by materials in walls or windows or pedestrians.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=E.J.

Due to their higher cost, plans are to deploy these cells only in dense urban environments and areas where crowds of people congregate such as sports stadiums and convention centers. The above speeds are those achieved in actual tests in 2020, and speeds are expected to increase during rollout.<ref name="Horwitz" /> The spectrum ranging from 24.25 to 29.5&nbsp;GHz has been the most licensed and deployed 5G mmWave spectrum range in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=FCC Auction 102 – 24 GHz |url=https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction102 |website=fcc.gov |publisher=Federal Communications Commission}}</ref>

Rollout of 5G technology has led to debate over its security and [[Concerns over Chinese involvement in 5G wireless networks|relationship with Chinese vendors]]. It has also been the subject of [[Wireless device radiation and health|health concerns]] and misinformation, including [[Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic#5G mobile-phone networks|discredited conspiracy theories]] linking it to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

=== Application areas ===
The [[ITU-R]] has defined three main application areas for the enhanced capabilities of 5G. They are Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://electronicdesign.com/embedded-revolution/5g-it-s-not-here-yet-closer-you-think|title=5G – Its Not Here Yet, But Closer Than You Think|date=October 31, 2017|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106204238/https://www.electronicdesign.com/embedded-revolution/5g-it-s-not-here-yet-closer-you-think|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Only eMBB is deployed in 2020; URLLC and mMTC are several years away in most locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arm.com/-/media/global/solutions/infrastructure/managing-the-future-of-cellular.pdf?revision=72c22c02-de7e-43d5-bf10-5690d65352cd|title=Managing the Future of Cellular|date=March 20, 2020|access-date=September 24, 2020|archive-date=September 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923004715/https://www.arm.com/-/media/global/solutions/infrastructure/managing-the-future-of-cellular.pdf?revision=72c22c02-de7e-43d5-bf10-5690d65352cd|url-status=live}}</ref>

Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) uses 5G as a progression from 4G LTE [[mobile broadband]] services, with faster connections, higher throughput, and more capacity. This will benefit areas of higher traffic such as stadiums, cities, and concert venues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Heejung|last2=Lee|first2=Howon|last3=Jeon|first3=Hongbeom|date=October 2017|title=What is 5G?

'Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications' (URLLC) refers to using the network for mission-critical applications that require uninterrupted and robust data exchange. Short-packet data transmission is used to meet both reliability and latency requirements of the wireless communication networks.

Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) would be used to connect to a large number of [[LPWAN|devices]]. 5G technology will connect some of the 50 billion connected IoT devices.<ref name="newsroom.intel.com">{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-accelerates-the-future-with-first-global-5g-modem/|title=Intel Accelerates the Future with World's First Global 5G Modem|website=Intel Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=November 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906234205/https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-accelerates-the-future-with-first-global-5g-modem/|archive-date=September 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Most will use the less expensive Wi-Fi.

== Performance ==
{{speculation|date=January 2022}}

=== Speed ===
5G is capable of delivering significantly faster data rates than 4G, with peak data rates of up to 20 gigabits per second (Gbps).<ref name="Minimum requirements related to technical performance for IMT-2020 radio interface(s)"/> Furthermore, average 5G download speeds have been recorded at 186.3&nbsp;Mbit/s in the [[United States|U.S.]] by [[T-Mobile (brand)|T-Mobile]], while [[South Korea]], {{As of|2022|May|lc=y}}, leads globally with average speeds of 432 megabits per second (Mbps).<ref name="OpenSignalUS">{{cite web|last=Wyrzykowski|first=Robert|date=January 2023|title=Mobile Network Experience 5G Report – USA|url=https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2023/01/usa/mobile-network-experience-5g|access-date=May 27, 2023|publisher=OpenSignal|archive-date=May 27, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230527093730/https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2023/01/usa/mobile-network-experience-5g|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="OpenSignalGlobal">{{cite web|last=Fogg|first=Ian|date=June 22, 2022|title=Benchmarking the Global 5G Experience – June 2022|url=https://www.opensignal.com/2022/06/22/benchmarking-the-global-5g-experience-june-2022|access-date=May 27, 2023|publisher=OpenSignal|archive-date=May 27, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230527094036/https://www.opensignal.com/2022/06/22/benchmarking-the-global-5g-experience-june-2022|url-status=live}}</ref> 5G networks are also designed to provide significantly more capacity than 4G networks, with a projected 100-fold increase in network capacity and efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=I |first1=Chih-Lin |last2=Han |first2=Shuangfeng |last3=Bian |first3=Sen |title=Energy-efficient 5G for a greener future |journal=[[Nature Electronics]] |date=2020 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=182–184 |doi=10.1038/s41928-020-0404-1|s2cid=257095960 }}</ref>

The most widely used form of 5G, sub-6&nbsp;GHz 5G (mid-band), is capable of delivering data rates ranging from 10 to 1,000 megabits per second (Mbps), with a much greater reach than mmWave bands. C-Band (n77/n78) was deployed by various U.S. operators in 2022 in the sub-6 bands, although its deployment by [[Verizon]] and [[AT&T]] was delayed until early January 2022 due to safety concerns raised by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]. The record for 5G speed in a deployed network is 5.9&nbsp;Gbps as of 2023, but this was tested before the network was launched.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wooden|first=Andrew|title=Faroese Telecom and Ericsson claim 5G mmWave downlink speed record|url=https://www.telecoms.com/5g-6g/faroese-telecom-and-ericsson-claim-5g-mmwave-downlink-speed-record|date=March 28, 2023|website=Telecoms.com}}</ref>

Low-band frequencies (such as n5) offer a greater coverage area for a given cell, but their data rates are lower than those of mid and high bands in the range of 5–250&nbsp;megabits per second (Mbps).<ref name="DeLooper"/>

=== Latency ===
In 5G, the ideal "air latency" is of the order of 8 to 12 milliseconds i.e., excluding delays due to [[HARQ]] retransmissions, handovers, etc. Retransmission latency and backhaul latency to the server must be added to the "air latency" for correct comparisons. Verizon reported the latency on its 5G early deployment is 30 ms.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5g/5g-latency|title=What is the Latency of 5G?|date=February 2, 2020 |access-date=February 6, 2024}}</ref> Edge Servers close to the towers can probably reduce latency to between 10 and 15 milliseconds {{citation needed|date=May 2023}}.

Latency is much higher during handovers; ranging from 50 to 500 milliseconds depending on the type of handover. Reducing handover interruption time is an ongoing area of research and development; options include modifying the handover margin (offset) and the time-to-trigger (TTT).

=== Error rate ===
5G uses an adaptive modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to keep the block error rate (BLER) extremely low. Whenever the error rate crosses a (very low) threshold the transmitter will switch to a lower MCS, which will be less error-prone. This way speed is sacrificed to ensure an almost zero error rate.

=== Range ===
The range of 5G depends on many factors: transmit power, frequency, and interference. For example, mmWave (e.g.: band n258) will have a lower range than mid-band (e.g.: band n78) which will have a lower range than low-band (e.g.: band n5)

Given the marketing hype on what 5G can offer, [[Network simulation|simulators]] and [[Drive testing|drive tests]] are used by cellular service providers for the precise measurement of 5G performance.

== Standards ==
Initially, the term was associated with the [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s [[IMT-2020]] standard, which required a theoretical peak download speed of 20 gigabits per second and 10 gigabits per second upload speed, along with other requirements.<ref name="Minimum requirements related to technical performance for IMT-2020 radio interface(s)">{{cite web|url=https://itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/rep/R-REP-M.2410-2017-PDF-E.pdf|title=Minimum requirements related to technical performance for IMT-2020 radio interface(s)|access-date=August 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108153048/https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/rep/R-REP-M.2410-2017-PDF-E.pdf|archive-date=January 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Then, the industry standards group 3GPP chose the [[5G NR]] (New Radio) standard together with LTE as their proposal for submission to the IMT-2020 standard.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theverge.com/2017/12/20/16803326/5g-network-specification-standard-3gpp-nr-official|title=The first real 5G specification has officially been completed|work=The Verge|access-date=June 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107224920/https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16803326/5g-network-specification-standard-3gpp-nr-official|archive-date=January 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1976-imt_2020|title=Workshop on 3GPP submission towards IMT-2020|first=Kevin|last=Flynn|website=3gpp.org|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107072115/http://3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1976-imt_2020|archive-date=January 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

5G NR can include lower frequencies ([[5G NR frequency bands|FR1]]), below 6&nbsp;GHz, and higher frequencies ([[5G NR frequency bands|FR2]]), above 24&nbsp;GHz.

=== Fronthaul network ===
{{Further|Fronthaul|Common Public Radio Interface}}
[[IEEE]] covers several areas of 5G with a core focus on wireline sections between the Remote Radio Head (RRH) and Base Band Unit (BBU). The 1914.1 standards focus on network architecture and dividing the connection between the RRU and BBU into two key sections. Radio Unit (RU) to the Distributor Unit (DU) being the NGFI-I (Next Generation Fronthaul Interface) and the DU to the Central Unit (CU) being the NGFI-II interface allowing a more diverse and cost-effective network. NGFI-I and NGFI-II have defined performance values which should be compiled to ensure different traffic types defined by the ITU are capable of being carried.{{page needed|date=January 2022}} The IEEE 1914.3 standard is creating a new Ethernet frame format capable of carrying [[In-phase_and_quadrature_components#I/Q_data|IQ data]] in a much more efficient way depending on the functional split utilized. This is based on the [[3GPP]] definition of functional splits.{{page needed|date=January 2022}}

=== 5G NR ===
{{Main|5G NR}}
[[5G NR]] (New Radio) is the de facto [[air interface]] developed for 5G networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-5g-new-radio/|title=What is 5G New Radio (5G NR)|website=5g.co.uk|access-date=November 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108184631/https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-5g-new-radio/|archive-date=November 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It is the global standard for 3GPP 5G networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comsoc.org/webinars/making-5g-new-radio-nr-reality-%E2%80%93-global-5g-standard|title=Making 5G New Radio (NR) a Reality – The Global 5G Standard – IEEE Communications Society|website=comsoc.org|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108184634/https://www.comsoc.org/webinars/making-5g-new-radio-nr-reality-%E2%80%93-global-5g-standard|archive-date=November 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The study of NR within 3GPP started in 2015, and the first specification was made available by the end of 2017. While the 3GPP standardization process was ongoing, the industry had already begun efforts to implement infrastructure compliant with the draft standard, with the first large-scale commercial launch of 5G NR having occurred at the end of 2018. Since 2019, many operators have deployed 5G NR networks and handset manufacturers have developed 5G NR enabled handsets.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2021-08-24 |title=Status And Future Of 5G New Radio Technology – C&T RF Antennas Manufacturer |newspaper=C&T Rf Antennas Manufacturer |url=https://ctrfantennasinc.com/status-and-future-of-5g-new-radio-technology/ |access-date=2023-05-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== 5Gi ===
5Gi is an alternative 5G variant developed in India. It was developed in a joint collaboration between IIT Madras, IIT Hyderabad, TSDSI, and the Centre of Excellence in Wireless Technology (CEWiT) {{citation needed|date=May 2023}}. 5Gi is designed to improve 5G coverage in rural and remote areas over varying geographical terrains. 5Gi uses Low Mobility Large Cell (LMLC) to extend 5G connectivity and the range of a base station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beebom.com/what-is-5gi/|title=What is India's 5Gi Standard?

=== New radio frequencies ===
{{See also|5G NR frequency bands}}
The air interface defined by 3GPP for 5G is known as New Radio (NR), and the specification is subdivided into two frequency bands, FR1 (below 6&nbsp;GHz) and FR2 (24–54&nbsp;GHz)

==== Frequency range 1 (< 6 GHz) ====
Otherwise known as sub-6, the maximum channel bandwidth defined for FR1 is 100&nbsp;MHz, due to the scarcity of continuous spectrum in this crowded frequency range. The band most widely being used for 5G in this range is 3.3–4.2&nbsp;GHz. The Korean carriers use the n78 band at 3.5&nbsp;GHz.

Some parties used the term "mid-band" frequency to refer to higher part of this frequency range that was not used in previous generations of mobile communication.

==== Frequency range 2 (24–71 GHz) ====
The minimum channel bandwidth defined for FR2 is 50&nbsp;MHz and the maximum is 400&nbsp;MHz, with two-channel aggregation supported in 3GPP Release 15. Signals in this frequency range with wavelengths between 4 and 12&nbsp;mm are called millimeter waves. The higher the carrier frequency, the greater the ability to support high data-transfer speeds. This is because a given channel bandwidth takes up a lower fraction of the carrier frequency, so high-bandwidth channels are easier to realize at higher carrier frequencies.

==== FR2 coverage ====
5G in the 24&nbsp;GHz range or above use higher frequencies than 4G, and as a result, some 5G signals are not capable of traveling large distances (over a few hundred meters), unlike 4G or lower frequency 5G signals (sub 6&nbsp;GHz). This requires placing 5G base stations every few hundred meters in order to use higher frequency bands. Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, walls, and even humans, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Massive MIMO ===
{{See also|Multi-user MIMO}}
MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) systems use multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver ends of a wireless communication system. Multiple antennas use the spatial dimension for multiplexing in addition to the time and frequency ones, without changing the bandwidth requirements of the system. Spatial multiplexing gains allow for an increase in the number of transmission layers, thereby boosting system capacity.

Massive MIMO [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] increases sector throughput and capacity density using large numbers of antennas. This includes Single User MIMO and [[Multi-user MIMO]] (MU-MIMO). {{citation needed span|date=January 2022|Each antenna is individually-controlled and may embed radio transceiver components.}}

=== Beamforming ===
{{Main|Beamforming}}
There are two kinds of beamforming (BF): digital and analog. Digital beamforming involves sending the data across multiple streams (layers), while analog beamforming shaping the radio waves to point in a specific direction. The analog BF technique combines the power from elements of the antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference, while other signals pointing to other angles experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality in the specific direction, as well as data transfer speeds. 5G uses both digital and analog beamforming to improve the system capacity.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rappaport |first1=Theodore S. |last2=Sun |first2=Shu |last3=Mayzus |first3=Rimma |last4=Zhao |first4=Hang |last5=Azar |first5=Yaniv |last6=Wang |first6=Kevin |last7=Wong |first7=George N. |last8=Schulz |first8=Jocelyn K. |last9=Samimi |first9=Mathew |last10=Gutierrez |first10=Felix |date=2013 |title=Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal=IEEE Access |volume=1 |pages=335–349 |doi=10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |bibcode=2013IEEEA...1..335R |issn=2169-3536|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=What is 5G Beamforming? |url=https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/articles/5g-beamforming-massive-mimo/ |access-date=September 6, 2022 |website=Verizon Enterprise |language=en |archive-date=October 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025035207/https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/articles/5g-beamforming-massive-mimo/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Convergence of Wi-Fi and cellular ===
One expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solwise.co.uk/article-5G|title=Article – 5G &#124; Solwise Ltd|website=www.solwise.co.uk|access-date=December 18, 2022|archive-date=May 16, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220516153358/https://www.solwise.co.uk/article-5G|url-status=live}}</ref>

NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ghafoor |first1=Umar |last2=Ali |first2=Mudassar |last3=Khan |first3=Humayun Zubair |last4=Siddiqui |first4=Adil Masood |last5=Naeem |first5=Muhammad |date=2022-08-01 |title=NOMA and future 5G & B5G wireless networks: A paradigm |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804522000728 |journal=Journal of Network and Computer Applications |volume=204 |pages=103413 |doi=10.1016/j.jnca.2022.103413 |s2cid=248803932 |issn=1084-8045}}</ref>

=== SDN/NFV ===
{{Main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}
Initially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access. Today a new era of innovative tools and technologies is inclined towards developing a new pool of applications. This pool of applications consists of different domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT), web of connected autonomous vehicles, remotely controlled robots, and heterogeneous sensors connected to serve versatile applications.<ref name="Software Defined Network for 5G">{{cite web|url=https://globecom2018.ieee-globecom.org/workshop/ws-21-sdn5gsc-software-defined-networking-5g-architecture-smart-communities|title=WS-21: SDN5GSC – Software Defined Networking for 5G Architecture in Smart Communities|date=May 17, 2018|website=IEEE Global Communications Conference|access-date=March 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308002935/https://globecom2018.ieee-globecom.org/workshop/ws-21-sdn5gsc-software-defined-networking-5g-architecture-smart-communities|archive-date=March 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In this context, [[5G network slicing|network slicing]] has emerged as a key technology to efficiently embrace this new market model.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ordonez-Lucena|first1=J.|last2=Ameigeiras|first2=P.|last3=Lopez|first3=D.|last4=Ramos-Munoz|first4=J.

=== Service-Based Architecture ===
The 5G Service-Based architecture replaces the referenced-based architecture of the [[Evolved Packet Core]] that is used in 4G. The SBA breaks up the core functionality of the network into interconnected network functions (NFs), which are typically implemented as [[Cloud-Native Network Function]]s. These NFs register with the Network Repository Function (NRF) which maintains their state, and communicate with each other using the Service Communication Proxy (SCP). The interfaces between the elements all utilize [[REST]]ful APIs.<ref name="SBA-RCR">{{cite web | url=https://www.rcrwireless.com/20210909/5g/what-is-a-service-based-architecture | title=What is a Service Based Architecture? | date=9 September 2021 }}</ref> By breaking functionality down this way, mobile operators are able to utilize different infrastructure vendors for different functions, and the flexibility to scale each function independently as needed.<ref name="SBA-RCR" />

There is a long history of fear and anxiety surrounding wireless signals that predates 5G technology. The fears about 5G are similar to those that have persisted throughout the 1990s and 2000s. According to the [[United States of America|US]] [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) "exposure to intense, direct amounts of non-ionizing radiation may result in damage to tissue due to [[heat]]. This is not common and mainly of concern in the workplace for those who work on large sources of non-ionizing radiation devices and instruments."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/nonionizing_radiation.html |title=The Electromagnetic Spectrum: Non-Ionizing Radiation |date=December 7, 2015 |publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=August 21, 2021 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231134227/http://www.cdc.gov:80/nceh/radiation/nonionizing_radiation.html |archive-date=December 31, 2015 }}</ref> Some advocates of fringe health claim the regulatory standards are too low and influenced by lobbying groups.<ref name="Meese et al 2020"/>

According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', one origin of the 5G health controversy was an erroneous unpublished study that physicist Bill P.

Curry had confused ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' research. However Curry's study was widely distributed on the internet. Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2019, [[William Broad]] reported that [[RT America]] began airing programming linking 5G to harmful health effects which "lack scientific support", such as "brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors, and Alzheimer's disease". Broad asserted that the claims had increased. RT America had run seven programs on this theme by mid-April 2019 but only one in the whole of 2018.

In the early months of the pandemic, anti-lockdown protesters at [[protests over responses to the COVID-19 pandemic]] in Australia were seen with anti-5G signs, an early sign of what became a wider campaign by conspiracy theorists to link the pandemic with 5G technology. There are two versions of the 5G-COVID-19 conspiracy theory:<ref name="Meese et al 2020"/>

#The first version claims that radiation weakens the immune system, making the body more vulnerable to [[SARS-CoV-2]] (the virus that causes COVID-19).
#The second version claims that 5G causes COVID-19. There are different variations on this. Some claim that the pandemic is coverup of illness caused by 5G radiation or that COVID-19 originated in Wuhan because that city was "the guinea-pig city for 5G".

In various parts of the world, carriers have launched numerous differently branded technologies, such as "[[5G Evolution]]", which advertise improving existing networks with the use of "5G technology".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cnet.com/news/at-t-brings-5g-evolution-not-real-5g-to-117-more-markets/|title=AT&T brings higher speeds with pre-5G tech to 117 cities|date=April 19, 2018 |first1= Roger |last1=Cheng  |website=CNET |access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106204643/https://www.cnet.com/news/at-t-brings-5g-evolution-not-real-5g-to-117-more-markets/|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> However, these pre-5G networks are an improvement on specifications of existing LTE networks that are not exclusive to 5G. While the technology promises to deliver higher speeds, and is described by AT&T as a "foundation for our evolution to 5G while the 5G standards are being finalized", it cannot be considered to be true 5G. When AT&T announced 5G Evolution, 4x4 MIMO, the technology that AT&T is using to deliver the higher speeds, had already been put in place by [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] without being branded with the 5G moniker.
