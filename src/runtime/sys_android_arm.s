// These trampolines help convert from Go calling convention to C calling convention.
// They should be called with asmcgocall - note that while asmcgocall does
// stack alignment, creation of a frame undoes it again.
// A pointer to the arguments is passed in R0.
// A single int32 result is returned in R0.
// (For more results, make an args/results structure.)
