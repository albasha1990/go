The [debug/elf] package has been enhanced to include support for handling dynamic versioning information in ELF files. This update introduces new constants, types, and methods that enable detailed parsing and inspection of version flags and dependencies.
- [DynamicVersions] returns version information for a dynamic object.
- [DynamicVersionNeeds] returns version dependencies for a dynamic object.
